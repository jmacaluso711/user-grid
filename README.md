## Quick Start

  1. clone this repo
  2. npm install
  3. npm start

The site will open at `localhost:3000`.

## Login

password: "test#frontend"

## Notes

- Authentication is faked using an auth function along with a Protected route.
- The session is store using `sessionStorage`
- CSS: Ideally I would have used `styled-components` but for the sake of this exercise they are done globally.
- Light design pass pulling some color inspiration from your website.
